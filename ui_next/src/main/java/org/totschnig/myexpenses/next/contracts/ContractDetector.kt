 * 1. Payments are grouped by direction and by the template they were created from, otherwise
 *    by payee. Payments without either are ignored.
 * 2. If the whole group is debited regularly with similar amounts (price changes allowed),
 *    it is one contract. Otherwise the group is split into clusters of similar amounts
 *    (e.g. two different subscriptions from the same payee). Clusters that follow each other
 *    in the rhythm of the series are joined again, since they are one contract with a larger
 *    change of the amount, e.g. a raise of the salary. Each resulting series is checked.
 * 3. A series is regular, if the median of the days between its debits matches a
 *    [ContractInterval] and at least [MIN_REGULAR_SHARE] of all gaps match that interval.
