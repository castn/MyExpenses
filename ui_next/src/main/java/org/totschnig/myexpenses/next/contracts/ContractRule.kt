/**
 * Decision of the user about which payments form a contract (or a regular income), or that they
 * do not. Unlike a suggestion of [ContractDetector], a contract defined by a rule does not depend on
 * heuristics: every matching payment belongs to it, whatever its amount or date.
 *
 * A payment matches, if it goes in [direction], comes from the template [templateId] or from one of
 * [payeeIds], and, if given, its amount lies in [amountRange].
 *
 * @param amountRange absolute amounts in minor units, only for payees that also have payments
 * with other amounts that are not part of the contract, e.g. single orders besides a subscription
 * @param interval how often the contract is paid, as confirmed by the user
 * @param name custom name
 * @param areaKey key of the chosen [ContractArea], [ContractSettings.AREA_NONE] for none,
 * null for the suggested one
